About
=====

The gobert project is a Go library implementing the [BERT serialization and
RPC protocol](http://bert-rpc.org/).

Status
======

I, Seth Klein, don't use this library. I updated it to Go 1 for someone
in #go-nuts and the original maintainer [declared it dead](#history) so I
figured I'd do the basics and handle bug reports and pull requests. As of
February, 2013, the last post to the [BERT mailing
list](http://groups.google.com/group/bert-rpc) was nearly two years ago so
unless this gets serious interest, I'm not going to sink oodles of effort into
figuring out what full BERT compliance is or whether this library implements
it. (The original author implies that it doesn't.) Feel free to report bugs
and make pull requests, though.

Reporting Bugs

History
=======

The gobert project was started by Joshua Peek in 2009. In 2013 he [confirmed
that he was no longer maintaining
it](https://twitter.com/joshpeek/status/299891081649209344), and Seth W.
Klein assumed maintenance. As the last update on this was in 2013, Landon Wainwright
has added in support for more tag specs.. I aim to create pull requests to merge this back
into the original source when I am happy it is all working.
